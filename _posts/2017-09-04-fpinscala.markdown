After spending a lot of time in java land and some time in clojure land, I really want to continue working with functional programming languages and have chosen Scala as the next language to learn.  The benefits of fp in clojure, I have experienced are:

- working with immutable data - easier to reason about your code.
- higher order functions - more code reusability.
- powerful library of functions - so you don't have roll your own as much.
- powerful reusable data structures - a lot of the time lists, maps and trees can be used instead of creating custom classes, which just makes things more verbose.
- pure functions - easier to reason about and test.

I am now learning about Functional Programming in Scala, by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.  Current experiences are that it is a challenging book which introduces different types of monad to you as you work through their exercises.  It's not a book that you can just read - you have to work through the exercises to get the most out of it, by downloading the accompanying code from their [github project][fpinscala-code].

As the authors are contributors to scalaz, using scalaz with Scala seems to be the natural path to follow after completing the book.
